            <h2>End-To-End Deep Learning, Patient-Level Insomnia Classification</h2>
            <h3>2021</h3>
            <p>I undertook my Thesis in my final year of study. My Thesis was presented as an e-poster at the <a href="https://embs.papercept.net/conferences/conferences/EMBC22/program/EMBC22_ContentListWeb_2.html#tuep-34_01">IEEE EMB 2022 Conference</a> in Glasgow, Scotland. This would not have been possible without the continued guidance and mentorship provided by my supervisors <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/beena-ahmed>Beena Ahmed</a> and <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/mostafa-shahin>Mostafa Shahin</a>. Please feel free to download a 4-page summary <a href="/files/thesis-4page.pdf">here</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper we propose a novel deep learning based, end-to-end approach for patient-level insomnia classification with two distinct model architectures based off one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) versions of the computer vision Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), AlexNet. We achieved up to 94.4% and 88.9% patient-level classification accuracy via our 1D and 2D models respectively. Clinical Relevanceâ€” Clinical diagnosis of insomnia is traditionally a time-consuming process. The proposed work could be coupled with existing wearable technology to deliver patients with a quick a pathway to an insomnia diagnosis.</p>
