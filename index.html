                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper we propose a novel deep learning based, end-to-end approach for patient-level insomnia classification with two distinct model architectures based off one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) versions of the computer vision Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), AlexNet. We achieved up to 94.4% and 88.9% patient-level classification accuracy via our 1D and 2D models respectively. Clinical Relevance— Clinical diagnosis of insomnia is traditionally a time-consuming process. The proposed work could be coupled with existing wearable technology to deliver patients with a quick a pathway to an insomnia diagnosis.</p>
