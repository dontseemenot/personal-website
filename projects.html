            EMBS Research Poster Paper: End-To-End Deep Learning, Patient-Level Insomnia Classification (2021-22)
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
            <strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>In this paper we propose a novel deep learning based, end-to-end approach for patient-level insomnia classification with two distinct model architectures based off one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) versions of the computer vision Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), AlexNet. We achieved up to 94.4% and 88.9% patient-level classification accuracy via our 1D and 2D models respectively. Clinical Relevanceâ€” Clinical diagnosis of insomnia is traditionally a time-consuming process. The proposed work could be coupled with existing wearable technology to deliver patients with a quick a pathway to an insomnia diagnosis.</em>
            <br><br>
            In 2021 I completed my Bachelor of Electrical Engineering Thesis. Whilst I was interning at ResMed, I was inspired to focus my research within the healthcare industry and chose insomnia diagnosis as it is a very underdiagnosed disease affecting almost 1 in 3 adults. It also presented an opportunity for me to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I had learnt from both my degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, such as signal processing and deep learning, resulting in a very unique Thesis topic. After the Thesis period, I refined my research further to be submitted and presented at the annual flagship <a href="https://embc.embs.org/2022/">IEEE EMBS 2022 Conference</a> in Glasgow, Scotland.
            <br><br>
            I owe many thanks to the mentorship and guidance of my supervisors throughout the duration of my research, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/beena-ahmed>Beena Ahmed</a> and <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/mostafa-shahin>Mostafa Shahin</a>.

            E-Commerce Coffee Bean Shop (2021)
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
            For my final year Computer Science project, I prototyped an e-commerce website that sold cafe related goods such as coffees, milks, meal kits, and desserts. Besides from basic functionality required for typical e-commerce websites, standout features I programmed were:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Cafepass - a loyalty program that offers tiers of discounts based on total amount spent</li>
                <li>Recommendation System - products are suggested based on previously viewed and purchased products</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            I focused on building all the backend components from the ground up. My choice of technology stack was SQLite for the database, Python for the business logic, and Flask for the web framework. These were lightweight and easy to pick up technologies suitable for prototyping, while not offering too much abstraction (e.g. Django) such that I could not learn fundamentals of creating a web app. I designed the RDBMS and SQL schema to show all the relational mappings. The backend was built as a REST API, given that CRUD operations were required to be performed on the database regularly.
            <br><br>
            Tackling on this project, I was able to appreciate the logical thinking and problem solving process in delivering core functionality to the end user, hence my motivation in purusing a career in backend engineering.
