            EMBS Research Poster Paper: End-To-End Deep Learning, Patient-Level Insomnia Classification (2021-22)
        </div>
        <div class="desc">
            <strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>In this paper we propose a novel deep learning based, end-to-end approach for patient-level insomnia classification with two distinct model architectures based off one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) versions of the computer vision Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), AlexNet. We achieved up to 94.4% and 88.9% patient-level classification accuracy via our 1D and 2D models respectively. Clinical Relevanceâ€” Clinical diagnosis of insomnia is traditionally a time-consuming process. The proposed work could be coupled with existing wearable technology to deliver patients with a quick a pathway to an insomnia diagnosis.</em>

            In 2021 I completed my Bachelor of Electrical Engineering Thesis. Whilst I was interning at ResMed, I was inspired to focus my research within the healthcare industry and chose insomnia diagnosis as it is a very underdiagnosed disease affecting almost 1 in 3 adults. It also presented an opportunity for me to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I had learnt from both my degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, such as signal processing and deep learning, resulting in a very unique Thesis topic. After the Thesis period, I refined my research further to be submitted and presented at the annual flagship <a href="https://embc.embs.org/2022/">IEEE EMBS 2022 Conference</a> in Glasgow, Scotland.
            <br><br>
            I owe many thanks to the mentorship and guidance of my supervisors throughout the duration of my research, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/beena-ahmed>Beena Ahmed</a> and <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/mostafa-shahin>Mostafa Shahin</a>.
